        <h1>Laugh OUt Loud</h1>
        <p>Smile Page</p>
        <h2>Got me LOL</h2>
        <p>This type of humor can be perceived as dry or not even funny to some 
          people but for me it is hilarious. I enjoy watching Sara Saffari because 
          she makes the funniest joke of the “perceptions” people may have of the gym.
          Along with Bradley Martin Sara creates funny content that makes laugh and motivates
          to workout. Sara is one of the many influencers I look up to because she seems real
          and a humorous person.</p>

        <h2>On repeat</h2>
        <p>Daniela Rodrice is a totally different level personality. Whenever I find myself
          bored and sad. I tend to watch some of her videos because the way she interacts with
          the audience is hilarious. She is a Spanish speaker therefore some of the things she
          mentions in her videos I can relate to. Most of her sayings remind me of home and how
          my mom speaks to me. Daniela does have more drama in her videos which make them extra
          entertaining and fun to watch.</p>

        <h2>Amusement in Hospitals?</h2>
        <p>Whenever people mentioned Grey’s anatomy I used to think what a boring show
          to watch to just see science and doctors talk about more science. It is more 
          than science and one of my favorite parts of this show is the humor they put 
          into most of their episodes. I've had some moments where I could not stop
          laughing while watching this great show. It is a super long show but it is 
          totally worth watching.</p>
