        <h2>Strong Woman</h2>
        <p>Fitness is not just about building a fit body. Fitness is about discipline and a mental game. Most people who enjoy working out are fighting more than physical pain.</p>
        <p>Sara Saffari is a popular fitness influencer. Sara has a great character and personality. She is a Gymshark and Rawgear ambassador. Sara creates YouTube content, which I would want to do one day. Sara is my inspiration when it comes to working out. I admire Sara because she is a super strong woman emotionally and physically. She lost her father at a young age. Something she mentioned is that the gym became her escape place. The gym cured her emotional pain and helped her overcome traumas. That is why Sara inspires me because I can relate to her in many ways.</p>
